  Gatsby ReasonML Starter
</h1>

This starter for Gatsby is inspired by the default starter blog. Except this one supports ReasonML with its strongly typed, functional goodness.

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Install the Gatsby CLI.**

    The Gatsby CLI helps you create new sites using Gatsby starters (like this one!)

    ```sh
    # install the Gatsby CLI globally
    npm install -g gatsby-cli
    ```

2.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.◊

    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using the ReasonML starter
    gatsby new my-super-neat-reasonml-site https://github.com/iwilsonq/gatsby-starter-reasonml
    ```

3.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd my-super-neat-reasonml-site/
    npm run dev:bsb
    npm run dev:gatsby
    ```

4.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    \_Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).\_

    Open the the `my-super-neat-reasonml-site` directory (or whatever sensible name you gave it) in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
