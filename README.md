1.  **Deps.**

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Start developing.**


    ```sh
    npm run dev:bsb
    npm run dev:gatsby
    ```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    \_Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).\_

    Open the the `my-super-neat-reasonml-site` directory (or whatever sensible name you gave it) in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
